üìä E-Commerce Sales Performance AnalysisThis project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis pipeline focused on identifying sales trends, regional performance disparities, and customer value for an e-commerce business. This analysis utilizes a multi-tool stack, highlighting proficiency in data transformation, advanced SQL querying, and professional visualization.üõ†Ô∏è Technology StackComponentTool UsedPurpose in ProjectData Cleaning / ETLPython (Pandas)Initial data loading, cleaning, feature engineering (e.g., calculating Profit), and preparing data for the database.Database / QueryingMySQL 8.0+Data storage and execution of complex analytical queries, including calculating Customer Lifetime Value and Month-over-Month Growth Rate using the LAG() window function.Visualization / ReportingPower BI (or Tableau)Creation of an interactive dashboard to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) like revenue trends and regional breakdowns.DocumentationMarkdown / PDF ReportFinal communication of insights, methodology, and actionable business recommendations.üìÇ Project FilesFile NameDescriptiondata_processor.pyThe Python script used to ingest raw data, calculate the Profit column, and output the clean data source (cleaned_data.csv).mysql_queries.sqlContains the advanced SQL queries, including regional revenue aggregation and the use of the LAG() function for time-series analysis (Monthly Growth Rate).e_commerce_data.csvThe initial, raw input dataset used for the analysis.cleaned_data.csvThe cleaned and enhanced dataset output by the Python script, used as the source for MySQL and Power BI.üí° Key Analytical FindingsThe analysis was performed on sales data spanning four months. The key insights derived from the MySQL queries and Power BI visualizations include:Regional Disparity: The North region is the primary revenue driver, contributing the highest volume of sales.High-Value Customers: A query was executed to identify customers with a Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) exceeding $1000, recommending them for targeted retention campaigns.Growth Volatility: Monthly revenue trends show significant volatility, with a sharp drop in February followed by a recovery in March/April, indicating a need for stable promotional strategies.üìà Actionable Recommendations (Summary)The final report provides concrete recommendations derived from the data:Targeted Retention: Focus resources on retaining high-value customers identified in the SQL analysis.Stabilize Trends: Investigate the cause of the sharp revenue drop in February to prevent recurrence and ensure more consistent monthly growth.
